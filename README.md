# RNA_seq_portfolio_project
Portfolio project for the processing and analysis of raw FASTQ files from E-MTAB-11605 (Genomewide expression profiling of multibacillary leprosy lesions before and after multi-drug therapy)

## What data  is there?
- 10 Individuals
  - 2 samples each
  - 1 before MDT
  - 1 after MDT
  - 30% were responders to the treatment
  
## What research questions:
1. Is there any differentially expressed genes between the responders and non responders?
2. Is there any differentially expressed genes between before treatement and after treatment?
3. Given 1. or 2. Can a ML classifier be created?
